# DP Approaches

There are two different ways to store our values so that they can be reused.

### 1. Tabulation or the Bottom-Up Approach

- In this approach, we start with the smallest possible subproblems, figure out a solution to them and then slowly build itself up to solve the larger more complicated problem.

### 2. Memoization or the Top Down Approach

- In this approach, we start with the large, complex problem and understand how to break it down into smaller subproblems, memoizing the problem in parts.

### Examples :

**For Example** : Let's try to understand this using fibonacci problem.

The fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,...

The fibonacci equation is

```jsx
**Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
F0 = 0
F1 = 1**
```

### Solving Problem Recursively

- The recursion tree for f(6) is

a) **Code**

```jsx
def fibonacciRecursive(n):
   if n <= 1:
       return n
   else:
       return(fibonacciRecursive(n-1) + fibonacciRecursive(n-2))
```

b) **Complexity Analysis**

- Fibonacci eqn recurrence relation is :

Time Complexity = O(2^n)

Space Complexity = O(n)

### Using Top Down Approach

- The top-down approach uses recursion where the problem is divided into smaller sub-problems.

**Recursion Tree**

**Code**

```jsx
int fibonacciTopDownRecursion(int n, vector<int> &dp)
{
	// Base Case
	if (dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];
	
	// Recursive Calls
	else
	{
		dp[n] = fibonacciTopDownRecursion(n-1, dp) + fibonacciTopDownRecursion(n-2, dp);
		
		// Return the nth term
		return dp[n];
	}
}

int fibonacciTopDown(int n)
{
	vector <int> dp (n+1, -1);
	dp[0] = 0
	dp[1] = 1
	return fibonacciTopDownRecursion(n, dp);
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Time Complexity = O(n)

Space Complexity = O(n)

### Using Bottom Up Approach

- We can solve the Fibonacci problem by starting from the bottom i.e start by calculating 2nd term and then 3rd term and so on and finally calculating the higher term.
- We use a term tabulation for this process because it is like filling up a table from the start.

a) **Code**

```jsx
int fibonacciBottomUp(int n)
{
	// Intialize Dp array
	vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);

	// Base Case
	dp[0] = 0
	dp[1] = 1

	// Loop over each index of dp starting after the base case
	for(int i = 2 ; i<=n; i++)
		dp[i] = do[i-1] + dp[i-2];

	// return nth fibonacci term
	return dp[n];
}
```

**b) Complexity Analysis**

Time Complexity = O(n)

Space Complexity = O(n)

### Dynamic Programming vs Greedy Algorithm

> a DP algorithm will exhaustively search through all of the possible subproblems, and then choose the best solution based on that. Greedy algorithms only search through one subproblem, which means theyâ€™re less exhaustive searches by definition.

- Dynamic Programming is similar to the greedy algorithm paradigm.
- In both approaches, we use an optimal substructure, Where the optimal solution will hold the optimal Solution for the sub-problems within it.
- In Dynamic Programming, we find the optimal solution for every single sub-problem and choose the best option.
- In Greedy Algorithm, we only solve one sub-problem, based on an intial greedy choice.
