# 4.1.f.Backtracking

- First let's see the difference between Recursion and Backtracking
- **Recursion :-** it is a process in which a function calls itself as a subroutine until it reaches base case
- **Backtracking :-** it  ****can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem.
    - Backtracking may uses Recursion, to solve some constraint satisfaction problems
        - N-Queen Problem
        - Sudoku puzzle
        - Graph Coloring problem
        - Subset sum problem etc......
- Let us try to solve a standard Backtracking problem, N-Queen problem.
- The N-Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N*N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. For example, following is a solution for 4-Queen problem

- same problem is already discussed in class by drawing recursion tree, in great detail please look at the class  notes for this.
- On the same way try to solve the sudoku puzzle also.
